Heavily inspired by this video: [How to code your first cute application from scratch (beginner friendly & aesthetic :3)](https://youtu.be/btxGSJ3Dh8E?si=tV_NAuaTfOWkflEM)  



This simple app will show todays day and month. It takes that data from system date, so it will match date that you see at the bottom-right corner of your screen.  

You can drag it around by clicking and holding on any part of the window (exept "X" button)  

You can close it by pressing "X" button at the top-right corner.
